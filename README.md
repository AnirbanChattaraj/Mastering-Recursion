🌀 Mastering Recursion in C
“To understand recursion, you must first understand recursion.”
📘 Overview

This repository is a curated collection of recursive programming challenges in C, meticulously designed to strengthen your core problem-solving mindset, logical flow understanding, and functional intuition.

Each exercise progresses in complexity — helping you move from basic function tracing to elegant recursive problem decomposition.

🧩 This isn’t just a set of problems — it’s a journey to master the art of thinking recursively.

Lay the foundation by exploring how recursive functions call themselves and build up or unwind.

🖨️ Print numbers from 1 to N

🔁 Print numbers from N to 1

➕ Find the sum of first N natural numbers

✖️ Calculate the factorial of a number

🔢 Find the sum of digits of a number

Develop clarity on base cases, stack flow, and recursive state transitions.

✳️ Find the product of digits of a number

🔍 Count the total digits in a number

🔄 Reverse a number using recursion

💫 Check if a number is a palindrome

⚡ Find the power of a number (xⁿ)

Apply recursion creatively to solve mathematically rich and logical problems.

🤝 Find the GCD (HCF) of two numbers

🔗 Find the LCM of two numbers using GCD logic

🔢 Print all even numbers from 1 to N

🔢 Print all odd numbers from N to 1

💠 Find the sum of all even digits in a number

🧮 Calculate the Nth Fibonacci number

🧠 Learning Outcomes

After completing this repository, you will:

Grasp the core essence of recursion — the base case, the recursive case, and the return flow.

Build mental clarity on call stacks and execution order.

Learn to decompose complex problems into simpler recursive subproblems.

Gain confidence to tackle arrays, strings, and backtracking through recursive patterns.

💡 Think less like a coder, and more like a problem architect.

🕊️ Philosophy

“Recursion isn’t about looping.
It’s about trusting the function to solve itself —
just as in life, sometimes you must trust the process.”
